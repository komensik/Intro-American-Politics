## Couple bits of logistics

1. Unless we've already chatted, Essay 1 is due now

. . .

2. Please schedule your defense if you haven't already

. . .

3. I'm traveling tomorrow/Thursday

* No office hours tomorrow
* David Price guest lecturing Thursday
    + Think about what you'd like to ask a former member of Congress

## Exit Quiz Answers

1. Andrew Lewis argues that the connection between abortion politics and religious freedom speaks to a "fundamental tension" in American democracy. What is that fundamental tension?

. . .

Between individual rights and morality

## Exit Quiz Answers

2. Weaver and Prowse are critical of political science, as a discipline, with respect to how it has considered countries’ levels of democratization. Briefly explain their criticism.

. . .

By focusing on formal institutions and measurable indicators (such as surveys and voter turnout) the discipline overlooks uneven on-the-ground experiences of democracy (or lack thereof) in everyday life.

## Exit Quiz Answers

3. What does Corrine McConnaughey mean in arguing that voting rights for women were delivered "under partisan duress"?

. . .

Women organized for the right to vote in many states first, giving the movement added leverage to build political coalitions in support of the constitutional amendment.

## Essay prompt{.smaller}

At the beginning of his term, President Trump appointed Elon Musk as a special government employee  who would spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with modernizing the federal government and cutting wasteful spending. Musk had pledged "at least \$2 trillion" in budget savings. This goal was eventually revised down to \$1 trillion, and then \$150 billion. Within six months, Musk had left the administration with overall federal spending having gone *up*, not down, despite the abrupt (and legally dubious) cancellation of thousands of federal jobs and contracts.

Based on your understanding of the federal government's institutions, identify and explain one reason why DOGE was unable to achieve its spending reduction goals.

* There are many potential reasons to choose from. By asking for one, I am encouraging you to answer with depth rather than breadth. The only requirement is that the reason must be related to institutions.

The House is small.

The United States is the only large OECD country with a lower chamber smaller than the cube root of its population, and it is significantly smaller (cube root rule would mean roughly 700 seats, actual size is 435)."}

## Powers of Congress{.smaller}

Powers of U.S. Congress:

*   Make laws
*   Raise and spend money ('power of the purse')
    + Revenue bills originate in House
*   Declare war (formally)
*   Approve treaties (Senate)
*   Establish military/bureaucratic agencies
*   Establish lower courts
*   Print money
*   Regulate interstate commerce
*   Manage the mail
*   Manage intellectual property/patents
*   Set rules for immigration/naturalization

## Powers of Congress

Congress's power of the purse is currently being contested.

![](images/scotus_pocket_recission.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Politico headline: Supreme Court clears way for Trump to withhold $4B in foreign aid approved by Congress. The ruling could further muddle negotiations over the impending government shutdown."}

## Powers of Congress

Newly-relevant jargon...

::: {.incremental}

* Impoundment
* Recission
    + Pocket recission
* Shadow docket

:::

## Impoundment is bad.

Impoundment is bad *even if you don't like the spending being withheld*. Why?

. . .

Raises transaction costs:

::: {.incremental}

*   Undermines credibility of government's commitments
*   Undermines congressional negotiations
*   Encourages policy [personalism]{.yellow}

## Checks of Congress{.smaller}

Some *checks* Congress has on the other branches:

*   Override presidential veto (2/3 majority)
*   Conduct oversight
*   Advice and consent on executive appointments (Senate)
*   Initiate/pass articles of impeachment (House)
*   Hold impeachment trial (Senate)
*   Initiate constitutional amendments
*   Sets size/jurisdiction of SCOTUS

## Vision of Congress

Congress as the "first branch"

::: {.incremental}

*   "refine and enlarge the debate" to balance common good with local interests
*   Senate as the more public-interested, "cooler"/less passionate deliberative body
    + Until 1917, not directly elected
    + Still: larger/more diverse constituencies and less frequent elections
      
:::

## Federalist 57

"The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, [first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom]{.yellow} to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of the society; and in the next place, to [take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous]{.yellow} whilst they continue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government."

. . .

Sounds like Locke.

## Congressional Representation

Different *normative* theories of how representation *should* work:

::: {.incremental}

## How a Bill Becomes a Law

:::: {.columns}

:::

\* Bill can be amended

^ Bill can die

## Unorthodox Lawmaking

Members can navigate gridlock via "unorthodox" procedures you didn't learn about in eighth grade civics.

. . .

Multiple pathways for a given piece of legislation to become law. [Rules and procedure matter!]{.fragment}

. . .

*   Major bills may bypass committee system via [discharge petition]{.yellow} (rare) or [special rules]{.yellow} (common, in House)
    + Special rules for Patriot Act, Affordable Care Act, e.g.

. . .

Special rules may require revising policy to fit procedure (ACA individual mandate, e.g.).

## Broad Strokes Goals

The rules, organization, and norms in Congress are all generally geared toward some high-level functions

*   Acquiring information (committees, e.g.)
*   Coordinating action (delegating authority to party leaders, e.g.)
*   Resolving conflict (remarks submitted in advance, e.g.)

. . .

Lots of veto points by design, heavy status quo bias

*   Partisanship stronger
    + Out-partisans less willing to give credit

## Redistricting

Or, gerrymandering. [Why "gerrymandering"?]{.fragment}

. . .

![](images/og_gerrymander.jpeg){fig-alt="Cartoon lampooning 'The Gerry-mander', depicting Eldridge Gerry's district as a salamander-like monster."}

## Redistricting

The authority to draw district lines is formally left to the states. 

. . .

For most states, state legislatures draw the lines (but may delegate)

* *typically* once every ten years, after the census

## Redistricting

## "Cracking" and "Packing"

![](images/cracking_packing.png){fig-alt="Illustration of 'cracking and packing' gerrymandering strategies. In theory, a constituency with equal numbers of green and purple dots can be apportioned such that there are green majorities in five districts by 'packing' a concentrated set of purple dots into a single district where it is the overwhelming majority (wasting a lot of their votes). Or the same constituency can be rearranged to have four purple majority districts and only two green majority districts by 'cracking' that same concentration of purple dots to distribute them across all of the districts. This is then shown in practice in North Carolina (using a previous district map), where some cities are 'cracked' to dilute Democratic votes (Asheville, Greensboro, Greenville) while others are 'packed' to waste Democratic votes (Charlotte, Raleigh)."}
