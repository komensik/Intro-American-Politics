Multiple correct answers, including high quotas forcing agents to focus on non-criminal immigrants (criminals are harder to find), which is in tension with other stated priorities and requires working longer/harder hours to process more detainees. 


## This week

The judiciary (mostly the Supreme Court)

![](images/court2022.jpeg){fig-align="center", fig-alt="Official photo of the current Supreme Court justices"}

## Origins of the Supreme Court

. . .

No courts under Articles --> difficult to resolve disputes between states.

. . .

Delegates at Constitutional Convention agreed some arbiter necessary[...but it's the third branch for a reason.]{.fragment}

## The Least Dangerous Branch?{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

"...the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the [least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution]{.yellow}...The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has [no influence over either the sword or the purse]{.yellow}...It may truly be said to have [neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment]{.yellow}; and must ultimately [depend upon the aid of the executive arm]{.yellow} even for the efficacy of its judgments." - Federalist 78

## Judicial Review

What is it?

. . .

Courts can evaluate whether executive/legislative actions violate the Constitution.

. . .

Referenced in Federalist 78, but not explicit in the Constitution itself.

## Judicial Review

What is it *not*?

. . .

Interpretation/evaluation of adherence to federal *statutes*. This is a more basic power.

## Judicial Review

Judicial review comes in many forms. In the US (compared to elsewhere), it is relatively strong.

. . .

Other democracies (and some U.S. states) impose supermajority requirements or allow legislative override.

. . .

Congress technically has power to regulate Court's jurisdiction, but hasn't asserted it.

## Marbury v. Madison (1803)

Background:

. . .

Judiciary Act of 1801: Federalists, having just lost the election of 1800, reduce size of Supreme Court and rush to fill new federal court positions on their way out

. . .

On final night of Adams presidency, five signed/sealed appointment letters (including Marbury's) get left on a desk. 

On first morning of Jefferson presidency, Madison (new Secretary of State) chooses not to deliver them.

. . .

Marbury sues for his position.

## Marbury v. Madison (1803)

Three questions:

::: {.incremental}

*   Does Marbury deserve the position? [Yes.]{.fragment}
*   Should there be a legal remedy? [Yes.]{.fragment}
*   Can the Supreme Court provide it? [No!]{.fragment}
    + Component of Judiciary Act of 1789 that says it can is unconstitutional
    
:::

. . .

In ruling this was out of jurisdiction, Marshall asserts the power to decide what's constitutional. [No one stops him.]{.fragment}

## Why Marbury Matters

Ruling is [self-enforcing]{.yellow}.

. . .

Marshall asserts power of judicial review, everyone behaves *as if* he has it.

. . .

Makes intuitive sense given a written constitution...but this was a *departure* from British rule (no written constitution).

## Evolution of Judicial Review{.smaller}

We've seen some of these before:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

*   Slavery / Jim Crow:
    + *Dred Scott v. Sandford* (1857)
    + *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896)
*   Economic regulation:
    + *Lochner* era
    + *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022)
*   Civil rights:
    + *Gaines v. Canada* (1938)
    + *McLaurin v. Oklahoma* (1950)
    + *Brown v. Board* (1954)

## The Courts and Democracy

The Supreme Court is a *counter*majoritarian institution.

*   Shielded from democratic accountability
*   Intervene against elected officials

. . .

Some reasons we might want this:

*   Protect against tyranny of majority
    + Independence from political pressure/trends
*   Safeguard rules of the democratic game

## The Courts and Democracy

This does *not* mean the Court is independent of politics

. . .

Justices are...

::: {.incremetal}

*   appointed/confirmed by strategic politicians
*   people with backgrounds, perspectives, and preferences
*   concerned with the court's power relative to Congress/Executive
*   concerned with court's democratic legitimacy

:::


## What Does the Supreme Court Consider{.smaller}

What it wants (sort of)

. . .

Per the Constitution:

*   Cases under Constitution and laws/treaties of U.S.
*   Cases involving maritime law or diplomats/public ministers
*   Cases where U.S. is a party
*   Disputes involving multiple states
*   Disputes between state and citizen of another state (updated in 11th Amendment)
*   Disputes between states/their citizens and foreign states/their citizens

. . .

Discretion over what to hear, some categories of cases ("political questions," e.g.) typically out of bounds

## Types of Jurisdiction

. . .

Original: hearing disputes as a trial court

*   Very rare

. . .

Appellate: reviewing/revising cases previously decided by lower court

*   Accounts for almost all cases

## Types of Case

. . .

Civil vs. criminal:

*   Burden of proof (who proves?) 
    + "innocent until proven guilty" in *criminal* cases, civil depends
*   Standard of proof (how convincing?)
    + "preponderance of evidence" vs. "beyond reasonable doubt"

. . .

"Decriminalizing" vs. "legalizing"

## Standing{.smaller}

Article III: judicial power extends to "cases" and "controversies"

In order to bring a suit, you have to have been harmed.

. . .

*Fairchild v. Hughes* (1922):

*   citizens in states that already had women's suffrage lacked standing to challenge 19th Amendment
*   can't preemptively challenge statutes/amendments that haven't passed yet

. . .

*303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* (2023):

*   can challenge ("clarify rights") existing state law you haven't broken (yet)
    + this is an expansive view on standing

## Collusionn, Ripeness, and Mootness{.smaller}

Cases need potential to provide relief to one party or another. Court can reject case for...

::: {.incremental}

*   "collusion": litigants want the same outcome
    + no controversy
*   (lack of) "ripeness": law not yet in effect
    + too early, no injury
*   "mootness": potentially illegal action has been abandoned
    + too late, no injury

:::

## Judiciary Acts of 1789{.smaller}

Set up three-tiered federal judiciary system

*   U.S. District Courts
    + Federal government is party
    + Civil suits under federal law
    + Civil suits between citizens of different states (if high enough $ amount)
    + Admirality/maritime disputes
*   U.S. Courts of Appeals
    + No original jurisdiction (hears appeals from District Courts)
*   U.S. Supreme Court
    + Cases from... 
      - U.S. Courts of Appeals
      - state supreme courts
      - Court of Military Appeals

## Formal Qualifications?

Who is allowed to be a federal judge?

. . .

Bound by norms, not rules. [Technically you don't have to be a lawyer!]{.fragment}

. . .

American Bar Association rates lower court nominees.

## Formal Qualifications?

Lifetime term under "good behavior." [What's good behavior?]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   Only 15 federal judges have ever been impeached; 8 convicted
    + Most recent removal in 2010
    + Only one SCOTUS justice ever impeached (in 1804, acquitted by Senate)
*   Typically involves serious crimes (bribes, perjury, e.g.)
*   Recent debate over adoption of (non-binding) ethics code for SCOTUS

:::

## Practical Qualifications{.smaller}

. . .

**Ideology**: [why?]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   Politicians make political appointments!

:::

. . .

**Experience**: [why?]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   External legitimacy
*   Track record mitigates principal-agent problem

:::

. . .

**Age**: [why?]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   Lifetime appointment means more at 50 than it does at 70!

:::

. . .

**Demographics (gender, race, religion, professional background)**: [why?]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   Substantive interest in diverse perspectives
*   Political constituencies

:::

## Clerks

Justices hire top graduates from top law schools to do a huge amount of work

*   Filter petitions
*   Conduct research
*   Communicate between offices
*   Help draft written opinions

. . .

Pros and cons?

## How a Case Becomes a Ruling

![](images/court_structure.png){width=80% fig-align="center", fig-alt="Diagram of the structure of the judiciary. Federal courts: U.S. District courts feed into U.S. Courts of Appeals feed into the U.S. Supreme Court. State courts: State trial courts feed into state appellate courts feed into state supreme courts feed into the U.S. Supreme Court."}

## How a Case Becomes a Ruling

Thousands of cases filed each term. SCOTUS typically hears ~75.

. . .

Court has wide discretion to grant writ of *certiorari* ("grant cert")

::: {.incremental}

*   1988 law removed main source of automatic appeals
*   "Cert pool" -- clerks filter applications
*   "Rule of four" -- norm governing when cert is granted
*   Discretion allows court to be strategic
    + Can avoid cases it doesn't want to decide

::: 


## Factors Associated with Granted Cert{.smaller}

Again, highly discretionary, but...

::: {.incremental}

*   Federal government asking for review
    + Solicitor general: the federal government's SCOTUS lawyer
*   Conflicting rulings in lower courts
*   Civil rights/liberties at issue
*   Ideological valence
    + Hear more cases from ideologically distant lower courts, e.g.
*   Significant social/political interest
    + Volume of *amicus* briefs

:::

## How a Case Becomes a Ruling{.smaller}

After cert is granted... 

. . .

Briefs:

*   Both sides submit written arguments
*   Outside parties file *amicus curiae* (friend of the court) briefs

. . .

Oral argument

*   Both sides state their case
*   Field questions from justices


## How a Case Becomes a Ruling

Conference

::: {.incremental}

*   Justices deliberate and state vote intention
*   Vote intention used to delegate opinion-writing
    + When Chief Justice in majority, they assign
      - When not, most senior justice in majority assigns
    + *This gives them power* to shape ruling's tone and scope

:::

## How a Case Becomes a Ruling

Opinions

::: {.incremental}

*   Drafts circulated
    + Allows justices to respond to each others' arguments
    + Sometimes justices *bargain* at this stage
    + Sometimes votes switch at this stage!
    + Justices can write separate dissents or concurrences
*   Drafts finalized
*   Rulings made public

:::

## Dispositions

Justices' votes actually have *three* possible dispositions, not two:

::: {.incremental}

*   Affirm: lower court's ruling stands
*   Reverse/void/vacate: lower court's ruling overturned
*   Remand: send case back to lower court
    + Can be combined with reversal

:::

. . .

Sometimes this means cases decided by *plurality*. [Decides case, but doesn't set precedent.]{.fragment}

## Unorthodox Casemaking

Shadow docket: fast-tracked rulings that skip most of the above procedures

. . .

Typically used in case of emergency, more frequently recently

Typically not considered binding precedent, but informative for lower courts

## Exit Quiz Answers

1 (2 pts).	Brennan and Scalia both mention capital punishment in their arguments, and discuss how their legal philosophy leads them to arrive at particular conclusions on its constitutionality. Explain their reasoning.

. . .

Brennan: capital punishment is cruel and unusual because it deprives individuals of dignity and "the right to have rights."

Scalia: capital punishment is constitutional because the founders clearly didn't consider it cruel and unusual.

## Recent Developments

![Lemley (2022), as told by The Onion in 1997](images/onion_scotus.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="The Onion: Supreme Court Rules Supreme Court Rules"}

<!--

## Measuring the Court?

One way political scientists like to measure preferences in a variety of contexts: scale votes.

![](images/mquinn_2019.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

What is this useful for?

. . .

What *doesn't* this tell us?

## Limitations{.smaller}

Can't scale votes that aren't recorded

::: {.incremental}

*   "Median" is relative, not absolute
    + Composition changes affect...
      - cases court is asked to hear
      - cases court chooses to hear
*   Behind the scenes deliberation/bargaining on language/scope

:::

. . .

Collapses complex reasoning into single dimension

::: {.incremental}

*   Gorsuch: strict textualist rulings in favor of trans non-discrimination, Native American sovereignty

:::

. . .

Lopsided/unanimous cases tend to generate less coverage.

-->

## Enforcement Capacity

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it." - Andrew Jackson (attributed)

::: {.incremental}

*   Compliance depends on *implementing* population and *consuming* population.

Example: Virginia's "Massive Resistance" (to *Brown v. Board*):

::: {.incremental}

*   Deny state funding to integrated schools
*   Governor authorized to close integrated schools
*   Redirected resulting funds to private "segregation academies"
*   Some public school districts closed entirely
    + Courts ordered them reopened, legislature made attendance optional
*   *Green v. County School Board of New Kent County* (1968): "free choice" plans unconstitutional (de-facto segregation)
