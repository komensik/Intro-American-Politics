## Logistics

First essay due (and second prompt posted) [this time next week]{.yellow}.

. . .

Soon: defense scheduling.

## Followup {.smaller}

Question from last time: why was Trump's executive order withholding funds from sanctuary cities ruled unconstitutional when other crossover sanctions aren't?

::: incremental
1.  [Separation of powers]{.yellow}: Congress has power of the purse, president can't redirect/withhold spending unilaterally (this will come up a lot later)
2.  [10th Amendment anti-"commandeering"]{.yellow}: can't compel local law enforcement to do federal law enforcement
    -   Difference between carrots for state policy and sticks for bureaucratic behavior
3.  (More specific to the specifics of the case) [Too vague]{.yellow} / allowed too much federal discretion
    -   Related to law vs. executive order in that laws let states make fully informed decisions re: compliance
    -   NH declined federal highway funds to keep drinking age low, e.g.

## Exit Quiz Answers

1.  Why does Frymer call his argument a reflection of "an alternate model of \[nation-\]state authority"?

. . .

Conventional accounts highlight institutional/military capacity for state building. Frymer argues that land policies allowed the US to expand via decentralized, largely private activity despite relative lack of military capacity.

2.  Grumbach and Michener argue that there are four main ways that the costs and benefits of federalism are distributed unequally. Name one.

. . .

1.  venue selection/forum shopping
2.  information asymmetry
3.  exit threat
4.  decentralized accountability

## Last week

Federalism

-   What is federalism?
-   Why do we have a federal system?
-   How has U.S. federalism evolved over its history?
-   Who benefits from federalism?

## This week

Civil liberties and civil rights

## Civil Whats?

What's the difference?

. . .

Generally speaking, we're talking about conformity costs:

::: incremental
-   civil liberties: where government [can't]{.yellow} intervene
-   civil rights: where government [must]{.yellow} intervene
:::

. . .

It's a little confusing that the Bill of *Rights* is where we get a lot of our civil *liberties*.

## Bigger Picture

Liberty and equality are two widely-accepted and *sometimes conflicting* traditions in U.S. politics and culture.

. . .

Big questions in civil liberties and civil rights often ask us to *make tradeoffs* between freedom and equality.

. . .

If the answers were easy, the questions wouldn't be interesting.

::: incremental
-   Edge cases test the limits of our principles
-   Necessary, but challenging, to prioritize abstract process over short term substance
:::

## Bill of Rights

The Federalists opposed including a Bill of Rights

-   Redundant (included in many state constitutions)
-   Unnecessary (unalienable rights in the founding)
-   Difficult to enforce (would depend on civic norms)

. . .

Conceded to help chances of ratification

## Key Liberties in the Bill of Rights

Shout some out (we're going to walk through them).

. . .

Two other key amendments:

::: incremental
-   9th Amendment: unenumerated rights to the people
-   14th Amendment: equal protection, due process
:::

## Incorporation via Fourteenth Amendment {.smaller}

Fourteenth Amendment: post-Civil War, split into five sections (including congressional apportionment, barring traitors from holding office, and guaranteeing public debt).

Section One is relevant here:

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

## Incorporation via Fourteenth Amendment {.smaller}

Due Process clause:

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; [nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law]{.yellow}; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

. . .

States cannot exercise authority *arbitrarily*

## Incorporation via Fourteenth Amendment {.smaller}

Equal Protection clause:

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; [nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.]{.yellow}"

. . .

States cannot exercise authority *unequally*

## Quick aside {.smaller}

The debate over birthright citizenship is about this:

"[All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside]{.yellow}. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

```{=html}
<!--
5th Amendment: "No person..." shall "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

. . .

14th Amendment: "No State..." shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

. . .

Initial interpretation limited to restrict national government / secure rights to freed slaves. Incrementally expanded.

## Incorporation of Due Process to States{.smaller}

*Allgeyer v. Louisiana* (1897): *substantive* due process standard

Issue: Can states prohibit in-state businesses from transacting with out-of-state insurance companies?

. . .

Holding: No

. . .

Upshot:

*   Burden of proof on government (incl. states) to show laws not arbitrary/unjust
    + Particularly when regulating economic activity (such as contracts)

## *Gitlow v. New York* (1925)

Issue: Can states prosecute individuals for speech advocating the overthrow of the government?

. . .

Holding: Yes, *with limits*. Sedition laws generally unconstitutional.

. . .

Upshot: Formal application of federal free speech protections to state law

::: {.incremental}

-   Extended to freedom of the press in *Near v. Minnesota* (1931)

## Selective Incorporation

:::::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
SCOTUS has tended to expand the list of rights deemed fundamental,[^1] but it's taken time

::: fragment
A non-exhaustive list by Amendment:
:::

::: incremental
1.  speech (1925), press (1931), assembly (1937), religion (1940), petition (1963)
2.  individual right to firearms (2008 / 2010!)
3.  [lol]{.fragment}
4.  no unreasonable search (1961), warrant requirements (1964)
5.  compensation for seized property (1897), self-incrimination (1964), double jeopardy (1969)
6.  speedy trial (1967), counsel (1963), jury (1966), & other rights of defendants
7.  
8.  no cruel and unusual punishment (1962) or excessive bail (1971)

## First Amendment: Freedom of Speech

Common mix-up between free speech [rights]{.yellow} and free speech [norms]{.yellow} or [values]{.yellow}. The First Amendment restricts the [government's]{.yellow} ability to regulate what you say.

. . .

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The government can't prosecute you for hate speech, but Instagram can remove it. <!--[And I can ask you to leave.]{.fragment}-->

![](images/insta_content.png){fig-alt="Quote from Instagram's community standards: '**Respect other members of the Instagram community**: We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activites.'"}
:::
:::::

. . .

We adopt free speech norms in class, but your peers are not [constitutionally obligated]{.yellow} to tolerate your opinions.

## First Amendment: Freedom of Speech/Press

The government is.

## Early Test-Case: Alien and Sedition Acts {.smaller}

Early focus on "prior restraint" -- can't prohibit speech before the fact, but can punish after the fact.

## Later Test Case: Civil War

States (at that time) not bound by First Amendment.

. . .

<br>

During run-up to Civil War, state-by-state criminalization of criticizing state's stance on slavery

## Later Test Case: Civil War

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%"}
Lincoln:

::: incremental
-   Prohibited printing criticism of Union war effort
-   Arrested newspaper editors, ignored courts
-   Suspended *habeas corpus* (requirement to justify detention)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/lincoln.jpeg){fig-alt="Picture of Abraham Lincoln"}
:::
::::::

. . .

All found unconstitutional after the war

## Free Speech/Press: Where's the Line?

. . .

World War I: Espionage Act of 1917 criminalizes, among other things, leafleting against the war

. . .

*Schenk v. U.S.* (1919): "clear and present danger" test: government can violate liberties to prevent someone from harming themselves or others.

::: incremental
-   Pretty vague!
-   Court has also considered "clear and probable danger" test, accounting for likelihood of harm
:::

## Where's the Line?

*Bradenburg v. Ohio* (1969) partially overturns *Schenk*, establishes "direct incitement" test.

. . .

Advocating for illegal action *in general* is fine; inciting *specific* and *immediate* illegal action is not.

. . .

Quick question: is shouting fire in a crowded theater illegal? [The theater will probably kick you out, but, technically, not on its own.]{.fragment}

## Prior Restraint?

*New York Times Co. v. US* (1971)

::: incremental
-   U.S. government had lied about extent of Vietnam War
-   Department of Defense report illegally leaked to *New York Times*
-   Government attempted to prevent publication
:::

. . .

6-3 ruling in favor of publication with nine separate opinions.

. . .

Upshot: government needs a *very good reason* to prevent publication of true information.

## Hate Speech

Contrary to popular belief, there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment

. . .

Only crosses into unprotected speech if used to *intimidate* or otherwise harm

. . .

We may still informally "regulate" hate speech with social norms

## Symbolic Speech

:::::::: columns

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}

:::
:::::

## Money as Speech

Court has typically worried more about corruption than inequality in spending capacity.

. . .

*Buckley v. Valeo* (1971): limits on donations to campaigns OK, but limits on *independent* expenditures are not. [Affirmed in *Citizens United v. FEC* (2013)]{.fragment}

. . .

How that works out in practice comes later.

## Commercial Speech

Used to be much more strictly regulated.

. . .

<br>

Lying for money still not protected the way lying in other contexts is.

. . .

<br>

Spam is generally okay with some loose regulations

## What You Can't Say {.smaller}

Unprotected speech:

::: incremental
-   Written (libel) or spoken (slander) false defamation of character
    -   Higher standards in U.S. than elsewhere
    -   Especially high ("actual malice") standard if speech directed at public figures
-   "Fighting words" such as threats
-   Obscenity
    -   Miller test: prurient interests, "patently offensive," and lacking serious value
        -   Justice Stewart: "I know it when I see it"
    -   States/local governments tend to have discretion
    -   This gets difficult on the Internet

## Freedom of Religion

First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an [establishment]{.yellow} of religion, or prohibiting the [free exercise]{.yellow} thereof"

Two prongs:

::: incremental
-   establishment clause[: government can't officially sanction religion]{.fragment}
-   free exercise clause[: government can't interfere with private religious practice]{.fragment}
:::

## Freedom of Religion: "Wall of Separation" {.smaller}

Who can tell me about the Danbury Baptists?

. . .

Danbury Baptists worried about persecution as a local religious minority, wrote to then-president Jefferson.

. . .

Jefferson's interpretation of First Amendment: combination of establishment and free exercise clauses establishes "wall of separation" between Church and State.

::: incremental
-   Government regulates public action, but not private beliefs or opinions
-   Danbury Baptists don't have anything to worry about
:::

## Another Line in that Letter

Jefferson also wrote that "Belief lies solely between man and his God...[the legislative powers of the government reach actions only.]{.yellow}"

. . .

This line would later be used to allow states to ban polygamy. [Later decisions allowing drug use in religious ceremonies.]{.fragment}

## Freedom of Religion: Where's the Line? {.smaller}

Questions that recur in First Amendment jurisprudence:

::: incremental
-   When is state action overly intrusive? [Can states force Amish parents to send their kids to high school?]{.yellow}
-   When is state action "establishing" religion? [When can public school employees lead prayers on public school property?]{.yellow}
-   When does religious practice become too "public"? [Do religious hospitals' health insurance plans for secular employees have to include birth control coverage?]{.yellow}
-   What counts as a "religious" belief or practice in the first place? [Does conscientious objection to war need to be rooted in traditional religious belief for a draft deferment?]{.yellow}
:::

## Freedom of Assembly/Petition

"Peaceful assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime" - *DeJonge v. Oregon* (1937)

. . .

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="70%"}
But! Assembly still regulated:

::: incremental
-   "traditional public forums" have less restrictions
-   You likely need a permit to organize a protest that will block traffic
:::
::::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/protestor_rights.png){fig-alt="ACLU Know Your Rights. Protesters' Rights: The First Amendment protects your right to assemble and express your views through protest. However, police and other government officials are allowed to place certain narrow restrictions on the exercise of speech rights. Make sure you're prepared by brushing up on your rights before heading out into the streets."}
:::
::::::

. . .

Government and/or counterprotestors may disagree about what counts as "peaceful"

## Keeping and Bearing Arms {.smaller}

. . .

Anti-Federalists worried that national government would disarm state militias.

. . .

For most of early U.S. history, gun regulations mostly limited to banning possession by formerly enslaved people.

. . .

National Firearms Act of 1934 in response to a) better technology; and b) organized crime.

-   Challenged and upheld on grounds that 2nd Amendment didn't protect the right to own *any kind* of gun

. . .

Individual right to own guns for personal use not established by SCOTUS until 2008 (federal) and 2010 (incorporation to state/local).

There are reasons for this, but it leaves out a lot.

## A Founding Focal Point

Declaration of Independence: "all men are created equal" and are endowed with natural rights.

. . .

This is clearly not put into immediate practice. [But.]{.fragment}

. . .

The story of civil rights in the United States is largely a story of marginalized groups [acting collectively]{.yellow} around this [founding principle]{.yellow}.

-   "Separate but equal" doctrine: held that segregation doesn't violate 14th Amendment

## Progressive Era (1896-1917)

Technological change, concentration of wealth, and series of political corruption scandals sparked wave of activism calling for increased transparency, accountability, and labor power.

-   DOJ "preclearance" of changes to election administration
    -   Formula for determining coverage nixed in *Shelby v. Holder* (2013)

## Enforcing Civil Rights

How do we evaluate whether a law violates civil rights?

. . .

Variety of legal tests, depending on whose rights are in question.

## Degrees of Scrutiny

Strict scrutiny (case involves "suspect classification" of race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin):

::: incremental
-   law must have "compelling state interest"
-   be narrowly tailored to that interest
-   be the least restrictive means of achieving that interest
:::

## Degrees of Scrutiny

Intermediate scrutiny (if case involves sex or gender):

::: incremental
-   law "substantially related" to "important government objective"
-   means not substantially broader than necessary
:::

## Degrees of Scrutiny

Rational Basis (age, economic status, or other criteria):

::: incremental
-   is government action "rationally" related to "legitimate" interest?
-   does policy avoid "arbitrary, capricious, or deliberate" discrimination?
:::

## Degrees of Scrutiny: Example

*Trump v. Hawaii* (2018): upholds temporary ban on immigration from specific Muslim-majority countries

::: incremental
-   Majority: rational basis test, ban OK due to "sufficient national security justification"
-   Minority: (among other objections), [we should be using strict scrutiny]{.yellow}

## Exit Quiz

1.  Andrew Lewis argues that the connection between abortion politics and religious freedom speaks to a “fundamental tension” in American democracy. What is that fundamental tension?

2.  Weaver and Prowse are critical of political science, as a discipline, with respect to how it has considered countries’ levels of democratization. Briefly explain their criticism.

3.  What does Corrine McConnaughey mean in arguing that voting rights for women were delivered "under partisan duress"?
