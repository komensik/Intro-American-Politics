## Exit Quiz Answers

1.	For Mayhew, why is "winning comfortably" more important to a member of Congress than merely winning?

. . .

Winning narrowly is a sign of weakness that could trigger additional resources being deployed against them in the next election

## Exit Quiz Answers

2. Briefly explain what Matt Glassman means by "Most of the time when you lose in a democracy, you don't actually lose a vote"?

. . .

There are many veto points in Congress, and votes are among the last of them. Things like agenda control often matter much more.

## Exit Quiz Answers

3. Per Glassman, what is a *procedural coalition*?

. . .

A coalition that agrees to rules governing agenda control. 

In practice, "backbenchers support leadership agenda choices even if they don't like them, because the benefits they get from the leaders (...) outweigh the costs of occasionally not getting their preferred legislation on the floor and occasionally having bills on the floor they oppose."

## (Would-have-been) Exit Quiz Answers

1. Briefly explain what a "messaging bill" is.

. . .

A bill intended to make the opposing party look bad / show that you need more power to get good things done, rather than to become law itself

. . .

Let's talk about Lee's argument for a second.

## (Would-have-been) Exit Quiz Answers

2. Identify a collective action problem in the Furnas and Lapira report on congressional "brain drain".

. . .

Individual re-election incentives cut against increasing legislative capacity; low office pay and long hours lead staffers to leave for the private sector (other plausible answers)

# Finishing up Congress

## Redistricting

. . .

Or, gerrymandering

![](images/og_gerrymander.jpeg){fig-alt="Cartoon lampooning 'The Gerry-mander', depicting Eldridge Gerry's district as a salamander-like monster."}

## Redistricting

The authority to draw district lines is formally left to the states. 

. . .

State legislatures typically draw the lines (some delegate)

::: {.incremental}

* required once every ten years, after the census (which determines how many seats each state gets)
* districts must be roughly equal population
* Voting Rights Act prohibits "diluting" minority votes
* helps co-partisans *and some incumbents*

:::

## General Models of Institutions

How does single-minded seeking of re-election translate to congressional voting behavior?

. . .

Members of Congress do what they want.

## Pivotal Players

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

Players x rules x status quo = nature of policy change

![](images/pivotal_players.png){fig-alt="Figure 2.2: Pivotal legislation if the president is liberal. Depicts a single left/right dimension with the president (p) on the far left, followed from left to right by the veto pivot (v), median voter (m), and filibuster pivot (f). Gridlock interval runs from the veto pivot to the filibuster pivot (policies inside this interval cannot be changed via legislation."}

* P: President
* V: Veto pivot (33rd-most liberal senator)
* M: Median voter (50th-most liberal senator)
    + Proposal starts at chamber median and is amended from there
* F: Filibuster pivot (60th-most liberal senator)
* Q: Policy status quo

All players seek to minimize absolute distance between policy and their "ideal point"

## Let's Try it Out

Some implications...

::: {.incremental}

*   Status quo bias: passing legislation is hard
    + Harder as "gridlock interval" increases
    + Harder later in session [(why?)]{.fragment}

:::


## Logrolling and Omnibus Legislation

One way to break gridlock: trade wins via [logrolling]{.yellow}

. . .

[Omnibus legislation]{.yellow}: bundling lots of bills (major and minor) together at once

::: {.incremental}

* For example, might try to attach your bill as an amendment to a "must-pass" bill (like the National Defense Authorization Act)
* Earmarks (i.e. "pork") can generate broader support
    + Easy to criticize *other* people's earmarks, but very Madisonian

![](images/presidential_seal.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Seal of the President of the United States"}

## Quick Refresher

What is power?

::: {.incremental}

## Roots of the Presidency{.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

*   Colonies: royal governors with executive power
    + Represented monarchy's executive authority
    + Powers included veto, appointments, military command, spending, (some) pardons, and lawmaking
    + Tensions with elected colonial legislatures
*   Immediate post-revolution government very much a *reaction* to this
    + Many states stripped governors of most formal powers
    + Articles of Confederation: no national executive
*   Need for stronger executive a key driver of Constitutional Convention

:::

-->

:::

. . .

George Washington in the background made some of these debates easier

## Nuts and Bolts of the Presidency

::: {.incremental}

*   At least 35 years old
*   Natural-born citizen (no naturalized immigrants)
*   Resident for at least 14 years
    + Diplomats need some domestic experience
    
:::

## Nuts and Bolts of the Vice Presidency{.smaller}

"...the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived." - John Adams, our first vice president

::: {.incremental}

*   Same eligibility requirements, none of the power
    + Preside over the Senate (except during impeachment trials)
    + Break ties in the Senate
    + Other tasks assigned by president (often given a nominal policy area)
    + President can temporarily delegate authority if needed (25th Amendment) 

:::

## Nuts and Bolts of the Cabinet

Not many specifics in Constitution about the president's Cabinet:

::: {.incremental}

*   Refers to "the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments"
    + Which departments? 
    + What to the principal officers get to do?
*   Legislation establishes agencies; presidents decide which offices are "cabinet-level"

:::

## Presidential Authority{.smaller}

Armed forces

::: {.incremental}

*   President freest to act in foreign policy
*   "Take care" clause in tension with Congress's formal war declaration power
    + Congress has delegated much of these (and other) powers
*   Vietnam War --> War Powers Resolution (passed over Nixon's veto)
    + President has to notify Congress after sending troops
    + Congress can vote to authorize their use/bring them back
    + Continuing tensions between President and Congress here
*   Present-day: can the president send the army into states uninvited?
    + So far, no.
    + This was a major concern at the founding! Against the premise of federalism.
    
:::

<!--

## Presidential Authority

"Take Care" clause

::: {.incremental}

*   Open to interpretation / ambiguous
*   Used to justify unenumerated powers of the presidency

:::

-->

## Presidential Authority{.smaller}

Appointments

::: {.incremental}

*   Arguably most consequential domestic power (will come up more next week)
    + Principal-agent problems
*   Senate confirms many appointees:
    + Cabinet, ambassadors, judges, e.g.
    + Evolving norms re: when appointments get blocked
    
:::

## Presidential Authority{.smaller}

Veto

::: {.incremental}

*   Some at Convention opposed veto power, others wanted *final* veto
    + Compromise: veto with Congressional override
*   *Threat* of veto adds to its power (actual vetoes are a sign of weakness)
*   "Pocket" veto: bill dies if no action for 10 business days *with Congress adjourned*
    + So Congress just stays in session
*   Signing statements: informal statements regarding interpretation
    + "Line-item" veto ruled unconstitutional

:::

<!--

## Presidential Authority{.smaller}

Trade agreements and diplomacy

::: {.incremental}

*   2/3 approval in Senate (rejection rare)
*   "executive agreements" if Senate ratification looks unlikely 
    + not binding for the next administration
*   "receive ambassadors" --> recognition of other nations
    + small words/actions can take on huge meaning

:::

## Presidential Authority{.smaller}

Presidents have claimed (emergency) authority to unilaterally set trade policy.

* International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA): 1977 law originally designed to *limit* president's authority in trade policy

. . .

President Trump not the first president to stretch emergency powers to set trade policy, but by far the most aggressive.

## Presidential Authority{.smaller}

Pardon/commutation/reprieve

::: {.incremental}

*   What's the difference?
    + Pardon: erases conviction, full restoration of rights
    + Commutation: keeps conviction, lessens sentence
    + Reprieve: delays sentence
*   Limits:
    + Federal offenses only
    + Can't use in cases of impeachment
*   Open questions:
    + Blanket pardons? Preemptive pardons? Self-pardons?

:::

<!--

## Pardon Power

Origins of pardon power:

::: {.incremental}

*   Short version: holdover from Britain
    + Crown + royal governors had pardon power
    + US provision traced to Hamilton
*   But! Debate at VA ratifying convention
    + George Mason (anti-federalist) objected
      - President can protect criminals close to them
    + Madison: if so, Congress can impeach

## Pardon Power

That hasn't happened, but something related has.

## Exit Quiz Answers

1. Neustadt clarifies that by persuasion he means "more than charm or reasoned argument." If not those things, what does he mean by persuasion?

. . .

The ability to convince others that it is in their interest to act in the president's interest.

## Exit Quiz Answers

2. Howell outlines two distinctive features of unilateral powers. Name and briefly explain one.

. . .

*   First-mover advantage: the president acts, puts the onus on other branches to respond
*   Unitary actor: the president doesn't need to mobilize allies or compromise to form a coalition

## Exit Quiz Answers

3. In his farewell address, Eisenhower highlights multiple ways in which technological progress might threaten democratic control of public policy. Name one.

. . .

Institutionalization of the military, expansion of federal funding for scientific research (less individual innovation in favor of government-directed projects, risk of policy capture by technocrats)

## Presidential Authority

Executive privilege

::: {.incremental}

*   Assertion of exemption from oversight
*   Unclear where the lines are 
    + *U.S. v. Nixon*: president cannot claim executive privileges to evade subpoenas/civil court actions

    + Jefferson claimed similar powers for Louisiana Purchase
    
:::

## Inherent Powers

What do presidents (Washington is merely the first) mean by "inherent" powers?

. . .

"Inherent" powers are still limited. *Plenary* powers, on the other hand...

    + Also claimed, baselessly, that Adams wanted to start a war with France
    + Callender went to jail for slander under the Alien and Sedition Act
*   Adams surrogates claimed Jefferson had run from the British, was an atheist, and would promote prostitution, incest, and adultery if elected.

## Paradox in Presidential Power

A key implication from Neustadt: Presidential power is *weakest* when it is *most observable*. 

. . .

Let's take a second to talk about this.
-->

## Going Public

Indirect exercise of power: directing attention to an issue by talking about it

. . .

President can *set the agenda*

. . .

When the president talks about an issue...

::: {.incremental}

*   The media talks about it
*   People think about it
*   This can put pressure on Congress

:::

## Going Public: Relevant Factors{.smaller}

Dynamics that affect the president's power to set the agenda?

::: {.incremental}

*   Attention
    + More media choice (cable, internet) --> more people tune out of politics
      - Those left listening are most engaged / least persuadable
*   Presidential approval
    + Low approval, low pressure
*   Substantive issue
    + Works better for popular ideas!
*   Point in office
    + Less power later in (second) term

::: {.incremental}

*   Direct the Treasury to pay for them
*   Without Congress authorizing deployment or spending

## An Unsettled Case: Debt Ceiling{.smaller}

Who can tell me what the debt ceiling is?

. . .

Statute that sets a cap on how much the government is allowed to borrow in order to meet existing obligations.

## An Unsettled Case: Debt Ceiling{.smaller}

Legal and practical tensions.

1788-1917: No debt ceiling. Treasury bonds authorized individually by statute.

. . .

1917 (during WWI): Second Liberty Bond Act 

*   Delegates authority to executive (Treasury) to issue bonds/other forms of debt
    + Provided they stay below specific limits for specific types of debt.

. . .

1939-1941: Public Debts Acts (amended through the 50s) 

*   Consolidate different types of debt
*   Formalize/periodically raise debt ceiling.

. . .

1950s-1974: Debt ceiling increases used as opportunity to debate budgetary priorities

*   Budget reforms in 1974 made Congress's spending authorization more explicit

## An Unsettled Case: Debt Ceiling{.smaller}

Between 1979-1995, "Gephardt Rule" automatically raised debt ceiling when budget passed.

. . .

Between 1995-2010ish, periodic increases a norm.

. . .

More recently (beginning 2011), debt ceiling used as leverage to negotiate policy concessions from president. [Why?]{.fragment}

## An Unsettled Case: Debt Ceiling{.smaller}

So here's the tension:

::: {.incremental}

*   14th Amendment: U.S. always pays its debts
*   Existing statutes make spending commitments
    + President must "take care" that these statutes are "faithfully executed"
    + President must spend money appropriated by Congress (no impoundment!)
*   But debt ceiling limits money available to pay debts

What can the president do when Congress [authorizes less spending than it has mandated?]{.yellow}

## An Unsettled Case: Debt Ceiling{.smaller}

President's options without increase:

::: {.incremental}

*   Print the money? [Risk inflation, also Fed vs. Treasury issue]{.fragment}
    + Theorized workarounds:
      - minting platinum coins (similar to printing the money)
      - zero-principal bonds that pay interest
*   Ignore the debt ceiling, keep spending[...and get sued]{.fragment}
*   Adhere to debt ceiling, triage spending[...and get sued]{.fragment}

## An Unsettled Case: Debt Ceiling{.smaller}

So far, debt ceiling standoffs (2011, 2013, 2021, 2023) have resulted in deals with Congress.

. . .

But (Democratic) presidents have faced increasing pressure to act unilaterally.

. . .

Unclear how that would resolve.

## Additional Presidential Advantages{.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

*   Congress acts collectively, president acts as an individual
*   Delegation risks principal-agent problem
    + President especially difficult to control as an "agent"
*   President appoints Supreme Court
    + Congress is getting more assertive here
      - But not from POV of Congress *as an institution*
*   President can act as *first mover*

## First Mover Advantage{.smaller}

Considered in spatial terms...

![](images/pivotal_president_setup.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Spatial model from Howell and Moe: from left to right: status quo 1, congressional median voter, veto pivot, status quo 2, president"}

* CM: Congressional median
* V: Veto pivot
* P: President

. . .

Where do these policies land if Congress moves first? [What if the president moves first?]{.fragment}

## First Mover Advantage

Let's consider this in spatial terms...

![](images/pivotal_president.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Two results. First, if Congress moves first, status quo one moves to the congressional median; status quo two moves as far to the left of the veto pivot as it was previously to the right of the veto pivot. Second, if the president moves first, both status quos move to the veto pivot."}

## Limits of First Mover Advantage

Why might the president consider moving first a last resort?

::: {.fragment}

Laws are "sticky," executive orders can be undone.

![](images/biden_reverse_eos.png){fig-alt="New York Times article, Jan 20 2021: WASHINGTON -- President Biden unleashed a full-scale assault on his predecessor's legacy on Wednesday, acting hours after taking the oath of office to sweep aside President Donald J. Trump's pandemic response, reverse his environmental agenda, tear down his anti-immigration policies, bolster the sluggish economic recovery and restore federal efforts aimed at promoting diversity. Moving with an urgency not seen from any other modern president, Mr. Biden signed 17 executive orders, memorandums, and proclamations from the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. Among the steps the president took were orders to rejoin the Paris climate accord and end Mr. Trump's travel ban on predominantly Muslim and African countries."}

Go to [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/advanced-search]{.yellow}

*   Search for signing statements (in document category checklist) issued by the president I gave you. 
*   Find one that raises questions about constitutionality or potential conflicts with other laws.

Prepare to share with class:

*   The substance of the bill being signed (teach us about the issue!)
*   The sentiments expressed in the signing statement
*   Potential deviations in implementation from Congress's intent
