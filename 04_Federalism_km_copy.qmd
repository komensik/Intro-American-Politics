3.  Juan Linz identifies two *institutional* problems with presidential systems. Briefly explain one of them.

. . .

::: incremental
-   Competing democratic mandates between executive and legislature. Especially under divided government, unclear who speaks for the people.
-   Fixed term for the president punctuates/heightens political conflict at specific intervals, when you might want to swap out the executive at some other time but presidents are difficult to remove mid-term.

## A More Perfect Constitution

Think outside the box! Some examples:

-   How many branches of government?
-   Interbranch relations?
-   National vs. state power?
-   Legislature(s) size? Election timing?
-   Who's eligible for which offices?
-   How are which offices selected?
-   Term limits? Who / how many?

## Tuesday Exit Quiz / Answers

1.  What does Riker mean in arguing that federalism "grants far more than is necessary for freedom"?

. . .

Federalism grants minorities the right to make policy without becoming a majority, not the right to have a chance to become a majority. This allows for minoritarian rule, which in many cases (such as the American South) restricts freedom.

# Finishing up the Constitution

## Federalist 10: Big Picture

How does Madison think about collective action problems?

. . .

Good institutional design *directs* self-interest toward cooperation

. . .

Small districts in a big legislature means:

::: incremental
-   Districts with clearer interests to represent
-   Coalition politics necessary to get anything done
    -   High transaction costs, low conformity costs
:::

## Federalist 10: Transaction Costs

"Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or [if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison]{.yellow}."

## Federalist 51: Distributing Power

"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition," using human nature to our advantage.

. . .

[In order to leave the state of nature]{.yellow}, even powerful individuals need to cede authority to a government. [This works better in a larger "extended republic" with power distributed vertically and horizontally.]{.fragment} [Why?]{.fragment}

## Federalist 51: Distributing Power

Dividing powers between branches is intended to give each *independent agency*

. . .

Giving branches checks on each other allows government to "control itself."

. . .

Dividing power twice -- (federal/state, then within federal) -- provides "double security"

. . .

Not the Virginia Plan! But a winning argument for Madison's audience.

```{=html}
<!--
## The Irony of Federalist 51

"In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency is to divide the legislature into different branches; and to render them, [by different modes of election and different principles of action, as little connected with each other as the nature of their common functions and their common dependence on the society will admit]{.yellow}."

. . .

The Virginia Plan went about this quite differently!

## Features of A Madisonian Republic

Extended republic means:

::: {.incremental}

-   distributed power
-   high transaction costs
-   status quo bias

:::

. . .

Why was this a winning argument for Madison's audience?

## How Democratic?

. . .

Overwhelming rejection of monarchism


. . .

Adopted democratic principles/premises, but skeptical of practical features

::: {.incremental}

* Still worried about mob rule / wealth redistribution
* No affirmative right to vote, franchise left to states

:::

```

## Bill of Rights

Concession made during ratification debate.

. . .

The first two didn't make it! [One found its way...in 1992.]{.fragment}

. . .

![](images/amendment_history.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="The compensation amendment would likely have become a mere footnote of history if not for a young student named Gregory D. Watson. In 1982, the 20-year-old University of Texas at Austin sophomore happened upon the story of the lost amendment while conducting research for a government class. 'This one pertaining to congressional pay raises immediately leaped off the page to me,' he later told the Austin American-Statesman. Sensing that he had unearthed an interesting topic, Watson wrote a term paper asserting that the compensation amendment had no expiration date and could still be added to the Constitution if the required number of states ratified it. Despite his enthusiasm, however, his professor didn't buy his argument. When he got his paper back, he found he had received a 'C' grade."}

## Amending the Constitution

. . .

It's hard!

A few different pathways. All but the repeal of Prohibition have followed this one:

-   2/3 of House
-   2/3 of Senate
-   3/4 of States
-   President, Supreme Court, and governors excluded

. . .

Amendments have tended to happen in spurts (post-Civil War, Progressive Era, Civil Rights Era).

# Federalism

## Quick question

Over/under: how many governments are there in the U.S.?

. . .

As of 2017...

::: incremental
-   One national government
-   50 state governments [(plus DC and territories)]{.fragment}
-   \~90,000 local governments
    -   \~3,000 counties

    -   \~50,000 special purpose districts
:::

```{=html}

## What is Federalism?

. . .

Federalism is a form of government that delegates sovereign power across multiple units.

. . .

Federalism is a "[bargain]{.yellow} between prospective national leaders and officials of constituent governments for the purpose of aggregating territory, the better to [lay taxes and raise armies.]{.yellow}" - Riker (1964)

## Big-Picture Theory

National leaders offer the bargain to expand their territory because [they can't do it on their own]{.yellow}.

. . .

Constituent governments accept bargain because they need protection or desire strength that [they can't obtain on their own]{.yellow}.

## Big-Picture Theory

Federalism is when...

::: incremental
-   Multiple governments cover the same land and people
-   Each government has at least one area where [autonomous authority]{.yellow} is [codified]{.yellow}
:::

. . .

Madison says federalism secures freedom. [Riker says not *necessarily*. Soviet Union met these criteria in a one-party state, e.g.]{.fragment}

```{=html}
<!--

## Some High-Level Consequences

::: {.incremental}

-   Forum shopping
-   "Voting with feet"
-   Coordination problems
-   Role for courts to adjudicate disputes between federal/state governments
    + This is going to come up a lot this week

:::

```

## Powers

Under federalism, some powers are...

-   Exclusive: [(federal sets up army / states set up police forces, e.g.)]{.fragment}
-   Concurrent: [(federal and state both work on roads, social welfare, e.g.)]{.fragment}
:::

-   Take property (eminent domain)
-   Enforce laws, establish courts

## Federalism Between the States

. . .

Full faith and credit clause: states have to respect each others' laws and judgments.

. . .

<br>

My marriage in Virginia is recognized in North Carolina.

## Federalism Between the States

Privileges and immunities clause: visiting U.S. citizens have same rights as residents.

. . .

## How Common is Federalism?

Federalism not *un*common. Australia, Canada, and Germany have federal systems.

. . .

But \~80% of world governments (incl. Israel, France, Japan, and Sweden) have unitary systems.

-   Includes cases where subnational governments lack important powers (UK / Scotland).

. . .

Confederations are very rare these days.

## Dual Federalism {.smaller}

Dual federalism perhaps its purest form: mutually exclusive "spheres of sovereignty."

Federalist 45:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution [to the federal government are few and defined]{.yellow}. Those which are to remain [in the State governments are numerous and indefinite]{.yellow}. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected."
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/madison.png){fig-alt="Portrait of James Madison"}
:::
:::::

. . .

Commerce clause and elastic ("necessary and proper") clause extend beyond enumerated powers.

## From One Type of Federalism to Another

Over time, contestation and interpretation has moved us from [dual federalism]{.yellow} to [cooperative federalism]{.yellow}.

. . .

Slow but (relatively) steady nationalization of power.

## Wither Dual Federalism? {.smaller}

Courts re-establish some state power in late/post Reconstruction:

::: incremental
-   1873: 13th and 14th Amendment don't cover state laws

-   1877: Reconstruction formally ends
-   1883: Civil Rights Act of 1875 ruled unconstitutional
    -   Restored right to discriminate in public accommodation (this comes up a lot)
-   Commerce clause allows regulation of inter-state supply chains but not intra-state production
    -   Anti-trust, child labor, e.g.

## The Great Depression

Interrelated and cascading economic crises (financial, industrial, agricultural)

. . .

Presidents Coolidge and Hoover resisted national response

. . .

Roosevelt / New Deal reforms dramatically expanded federal government's role in economy (and, by extension, power over states)

## Court Packing Threat

Elements of New Deal consistently struck down by Courts, prompting FDR proposal to expand court (and appoint new justices)

::: incremental
-   Court packing was unpopular (norm violation!) and didn't pass
-   But afterward, favorable rulings that limit state economic power

National government uses variety of incentives to influence state policy

## Carrots: Fiscal Federalism

Examples:

    -   Often in the form of a *crossover sanction*
-   Block grant [(Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)]{.fragment}
    -   Fixed amount for specific purpose
-   Matching grant [many infrastructure projects, e.g.]{.fragment}
    -   Percentage contribution toward specific project

## Example: Sanctuary Cities

It's a hot topic: what does the term mean?

. . .

ICE and CBP are federal agencies; states maintain policing power, cities can choose not to help federal immigration enforcement.

. . .

In first Trump administration, executive order to withhold federal funding from cities with sanctuary policies ruled unconstitutional.

## Competitive Federalism

Tiebout (1956): Communities offer different baskets of goods (public services) at different prices (taxes), people sort efficiently based on their preferences.

. . .

Some (not all) key assumptions:

::: incrmeental

-   Complete information
-   Equal financing of public goods
-   No public good spillover
