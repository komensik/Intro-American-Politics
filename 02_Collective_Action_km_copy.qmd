## Exit Quiz Answers

1. Eitan Hersh identifies two main problems caused by political hobbyism. Name one of them.

. . .

*   Hobbyism makes politics worse / sets bad incentives for politicians
*   Hobbyism distracts from actually doing politics / cedes the playing field to those who will

. . .

Some of you came up with *other* potential downsides of hobbyism.

2. Briefly explain what Levitsky and Way mean by "competitive authoritarianism"

. . .

Competitive authoritarianism is "a system in which parties compete in elections but the incumbent's abuse of power tilts the playing field against the opposition."

## This week

More fundamentals:

-   Are citizens capable of democracy?
-   What is the social contract?
-   Collective action and its problems

## Essay 1 prompt posted{.smaller}

If you could go back in time and make one recommendation to the delegates at the Constitutional Convention, what would it be and how would you convince *them* to take your advice?

* Bear in mind that you don't need to convince me that your idea is good, you need to convince me that you could convince *the delegates at the convention*. In this context, a winning argument might be different than a merely correct argument. 
* Recommendations may take the form of suggested changes to institutional design (i.e. amendments), but they do not need to. For example, you might warn the delegates of future developments they may not have anticipated (which would lead them to make different decisions).

# Information and Democracy

## Citation

Much of today's discussion comes from Chapter One of *What Americans Know About Politics and Why it Matters* (Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996), which I [almost]{.yellow} assigned.

. . .

This is a [very brief]{.yellow} overview of specific strands of political thought, used for a specific purpose. [Take political theory classes!]{.fragment}

Epistemic task of democracy: use information to collectively address pressing matters of public concern.

## A Democratic Paradox

. . .

{{< video images/undecided_voters.mp4 >}}


## A Democratic Paradox

. . . 

Classic and early-modern philosophers looked down on what we would recognize as democracy as rule by some combination of:

::: {.incremental}

*   the mob (risks demagogues)
*   the poor (risks wealth redistribution)
*   the incompetent (risks generally bad decisionmaking)

:::

. . . 

The people cannot be trusted to govern themselves.

. . .

And yet, people tend to value democracy as a form of government and it's done pretty well over the last couple of centuries. 

<!--
## A Democratic Paradox

Quick show of hands: can you name your member of Congress (wherever you'd vote)? 

. . . 

What about your state senator?

-->

## Why this matters

Why do proponents of democracy think it's better than the alternatives?

::: {.incremental}

* Fundamental right to self-determination
* Aggregation of private interests promotes the public good
    + Democracy solves information problems
* Democratic citizenship is self-actualizing *for democratic citizens*

:::

## Why this matters

But this only works if citizens have sufficient information and capacity to: 

::: {.incremental}

-   Be aware of and understand relevant issues
-   Know what they (should) want
-   Reason together about what they should do

:::

## Why this matters

Mass ignorance leaves three options:

::: {.incremental}

-   Reject democracy
-   Limit the scope of self-determination
-   Strengthen democratic citizenship

:::

## Expectations of Democratic Citizenship

Last week I said that democracy isn't either/or. 

There are different types of democracy, and systems can be more or less democratic.

. . .

Democratic theories vary in how much they expect of democratic citizens.

## The Social Contract and the Emergence of Liberal Democracy

This makes elections useful for two things:

. . .

-   Select high ability citizens as representatives
-   Check their power / throw them out if necessary

. . .

This offers a "thin" model of democratic citizenship. [All it asks is for occasional votes to protect one's private interest.]{.fragment}

. . .

But it is extended to more people who can limit government's excesses.

Until relatively recently, the answer was: [some]{.yellow} people.

## Why does this matter?

## Democratic Citizenship in the United States

Scholars often call citizenship in the United States "thin"

. . .

Our institutions reflect the (small-l) liberal democratic social contract tradition

. . .

Emphases:

-   indirect input on decisions via voting
-   protection of private rights and liberties
-   few *responsibilities* oriented toward the public good

## Democratic Citizenship in the United States

Competing traditions in U.S. political culture:

::: {.incremental}

*   Skepticism of mass politics

*   Faith in the individual/private sphere
*   Protectionist belief in voting as a check on centralized power
*   Communitarian belief in participation as self-actualizing (virtuous cycle)

:::

## Democratic Citizenship in the United States

This suggests a patchwork conception of democratic citizenship

. . .

Values both public good and pursuit of private interest

. . .

Varying expectations regarding the civic knowledge, virtue, and participation


## Democratic Citizenship in the United States


We treat political knowledge and civic virtue as resources[...without cultivating and distributing them.]{.fragment}

. . .

Result: unequal distribution of information, knowledge, and opportunity for authentic self-rule.

## Civic Virtue as a Collective Action Problem{.smaller}

Civic virtue as a resource we collectively cultivate --> information/participation becomes a matter of collective action

. . .

How so? [Think of some direct/immediate *individual* costs...]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   Time to collect and process information
    + Developing coherent belief system takes effort
    + Evaluating candidates/issues takes effort
*   Time to discuss politics with peers
*   Time/resources to go vote
    + or contact representative, attend public meeting, protest, etc.

:::

## Civic Virtue as a Collective Action Problem{.smaller}

The benefits of participation tend to be indirect/*collective*. [If you participate...]{.fragment}

::: {.incremental}

*   Your candidate you like *might* win/the one you don't *might* lose
    + You need a bunch of other people like you to show up too
      - But the odds your vote is decisive are slim
    + If your candidate wins, they *might* move policy in your direction
*   Your protest *might* advance its cause
    + Odds are better if it's a big movement
      - But the bigger it is, the less it hinges on you
*   Improved/shared understanding has limited direct *material* value

:::

## Civic Virtue as a Collective Action Problem

Result: inequalities in information/participation

"Rational ignorance" when marginal cost of acquiring information > marginal benefit of using it

![](images/first_amendment_annenberg.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Chart of percentage of people who can name specific protections of the First Amendment. 74% correctly name freedom of speech, 39% freedom of religion, 29% freedom of the press, 27% right of assembly, and 11% right of petition. 22% incorrectly name right to bear arms (that's the Second Amendment)"}


## This is Fine (?)

Consider:

::: {.incremental}

-   Trivia isn't politics 
-   Elite representation
-   Parties reduce complexity
-   "Collective rationality"
-   "Low-information rationality"
-   Ignorance is bliss
-   Full information doesn't exist

:::

## Why This is Not Fine

These points will come back later in the semester. They're good points! But we shouldn't be satisfied with them.

. . .

Capacity for civic virtue -- i.e. how much we *can expect* from citizens -- is a resource that can be cultivated and distributed.

. . .

One implication: the "democratic paradox" isn't a paradox.[..the less capable citizens are, the [less democratic]{.yellow} society is.]{.fragment}

## Types of Collective Action Problems

We just explored a specific collective action problem. Some broader categories:

-   Free rider
-   Tragedy of the commons
-   Prisoner's dilemma
-   Principal-agent

## Excludability and Rivalry

Some flavor of collective action is involved when managing goods that are...

* [non-excludable]{.yellow}: can't prevent others from consuming good once it exists
* [non-rival]{.yellow}: my consumption doesn't limit your consumption

## Types of Goods

| | Rival  | Non-Rival  |
|--------|--------|--------|
|**Excludable**| Private goods (food, cars)  | Club goods (HOAs, unions)   |
|**Non-Excludable**| Common-pool goods (parks, roads) | Public goods (defense, air)   |

## Free Rider Problem

. . .

Occurs when individual contribution seen as unnecessary for public good production.

*   rational ignorance
*   group projects
*   academic peer review

## Tragedy of the Commons

. . .

Occurs when cost to consume a common pool resource is absent/insufficient to moderate consumption.

*   deforestation
*   overfishing
*   air pollution

## Prisoner's Dilemma

| | P2 Stays Quiet  | P2 Confesses  |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **P1 Stays Quiet** |  1 year, 1 year | 10 years, Free  |
| **P1 Confesses** | Free, 10 years | 5 years, 5 years |

. . .

Variations:

::: {.incremental}

*   Repeated game
*   Losses or gains?
*   More than two players
*   Institutions (that make defection costly)

:::

## Student's Dilemma

![](images/116_ec.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Extra credit question from a previous final: 'Please write either two or five, indicating the number of extra credit points you would like to receive on this exam. If up to 1/4 of those who respond ask for five points, everyone will get the extra credit they ask for. If more than 1/4 of those who respond ask for five points, no one will get any extra credit. Writing down anything other than two or five will be considered abstention (i.e. you will not receive any extra credit and we will subtract you from the denominator when determining the 1/4 threshold for others). There are 32 students in this class. Assuming everyone writes down either two or five, this means that up to eight students can receive five points of extra credit, but if more than eight students ask for five points then no one gets any extra credit. If one student abstains, that threshold drops to seven."}

## Principal-Agent Problem

. . .

Occurs when player delegating action (principal) and player to whom action is delegated (agent) have differing goals/incentives

::: {.incremental}

*   bureaucracy (executive --> bureaucrats)
*   elections (voters --> politicians)
*   political campaigns (candidate --> consultants, volunteers)

:::

## Coordination

Before we talk about specific solutions...

If I asked you to meet another student on campus, but you didn't know who, where, or when to meet...where and when would you go?

. . .

Why would this work?

. . .

Focal points aid in coordination.

## Solutions to Collective Action Problems

When spontaneous coordination isn't possible (which is often), we use institutions!

::: {.incremental}

*   Ability to monitor, reward, and sanction
*   Can vary in how formal they are
*   Benefit from repeated iterations
    + Norms develop over time
    + Actors develop reputations

:::

::: {.incremental}

*   Congress
*   political parties
*   Krzyzewskiville

## Coercion{.smaller}

. . .

Institutions limit some behaviors (coercion) to enable others (cooperation)

. . .

Rewards

::: {.incremental}

*   Incentivize good performance
    + tax credits for *behavior*
*   Privatization (property rights backed by state)

Sanction
